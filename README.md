The test dataset used in the ONC Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge is available for download by students, researchers, or anyone else interested in additional analysis and patient matching algorithm development. More information about the Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge can be found: https://www.patientmatchingchallenge.com/.
